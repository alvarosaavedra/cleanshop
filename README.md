# CleanShop
The project tries to make an example of a shop REST API using typescript and clean architecture.
For this, it uses: 
* [express](https://expressjs.com/) as http server
* [inversify.io](http://inversify.io/) as Dependency Injection library
* [TypeORM](https://typeorm.io/) as ORM using mappers and repositories
